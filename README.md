# 💾 SQL Task 2 – Data Insertion and Handling Nulls

This repository contains my solution for **Task 2** of the SQL Developer Internship. The objective was to practice **inserting**, **updating**, and **deleting** data while managing `NULL` values and default constraints.

## 📌 Task Objective

- Use `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
- Handle missing values using `NULL` or `DEFAULT`.
- Populate a clean and consistent sample database.
